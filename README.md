# fangtagebuch (https://fangtagebuch.netlify.app)

When I catch a fish I always forget something. Because of that I coded this web app for me. 
Now when I catch a fish I can take my phone out and save all the important data and an image for the catch.

I also added the ability to create a User and login and out of the webapp.
Thanks to that functionality users can now create their own catch diarys after creating an account.

For all the backend I am using a serverless backend with firebase.
To save the Data I used the firebase realtime database and to save the images I use the firebase storage.
For the authentification I am using the firebase authentification.


Built with React.
