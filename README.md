# fangtagebuch (https://fangtagebuch.netlify.app)

When I catch a fish I always forget something. Because of that I coded this web app for me. 
Now when I catch a fish I can take my phone out and save all the important data and an image for the catch.

To save the Data I used the firebase realtime database and to save the images I use the firebase storage.


Built with React.
